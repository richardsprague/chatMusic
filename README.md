# ChatGPT-Generated Music

Here are the prompts I gave to ChatGPT:

> I'd like to generate a musical score for a cello-piano-violin trio. It should be similar to Mozart's Piano Trio in B-flat, but shorter and lighter. I'd also like a short flute solo somewhere in the middle.


> Can you write something in Python that can generate the piece?

> Instead of, or maybe in addition to, the MIDI file, can I generate an actual score that I can print?

Here&#39;s how I got it to make a musical composition based on Mozart&#39;s Piano Trio in B-Flat: <a href="https://t.co/e1f4PAHHts">pic.twitter.com/e1f4PAHHts</a></p>&mdash; richardsprague.eth (@sprague) <a href="https://twitter.com/sprague/status/1654336445287653376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 5, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
